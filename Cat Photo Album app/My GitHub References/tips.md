   <h1> Creating Folder </h1>
   <p> 
     Open main folder and type in file name with a '/' at end. Press enter. 
     Write placeholder file name (i.e. test). Then jump down. This will 
     indicate this is a FOLDER and not a DOCUMENT. #mindblown
  </p>
  <h2>
   To insert an image in folder: </h2>
     <p> Same as above step with exception that previously saved image 'file'
     (actually a document) in Ghub can be screenshot. Once screenshot is 
     taken, return to Ghub and copy image address. Delete previously 
     saved image file under subfolder (src) in Ghub. Open newly created folder 
     and insert image from computer into folder. Done.

  <h1> Creating Document</h1>
  <p>
     Open subfolder folder and name using '.md' at end of document name. 
    '.md' = markdown. #wow
  <h1>Quick Reminder</h1>
  <p>
   For images, press 'upload document' to drop screenshots of work into 
   image folder. Then, right click 'copy image address' to use image in 
   lessons learned file. For Lessons Learned, type the name of the file
   in abbreviated caps lock + markdown without any slashes. To insert an
   image in Lessons Learned, add the image source link of the desired
   image followed by the name of the image within the alt. For Learning
   Solutions, type the name of the file + dot html (with no slash) to
   create a document. The only time a / is added is to create a folder.
