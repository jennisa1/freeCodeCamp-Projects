   <h1> CatPhotoApp Lessons Learned </h1>
   <p> 
     Learned how to open and close HTML tags, found the Heading 1 element, 
     and changed its text to CatPhotoApp. Before learning, I used to refer 
     to HTML tags as "alligators" (like we learned in math). Now, I understand 
     they are in fact HTML tags that allow headings, ordered/unordered lists,
     images, paragraphs, and etc. to become code in a syntax format. Also 
     chose a picture of a cat and its temperment for the project hehe.

     Went through an interesting time trying to troubleshoot a broken link in my 
     repository. After countless tries and misplacing my link musltiple times, I
     researched a solution via Google. It was here that I discovered I needed to 
     add an onlick method to redirect my repository link. Thank goodness it works.
