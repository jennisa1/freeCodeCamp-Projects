   <h1> Creating Folder </h1>
   <p> 
     Open main folder and type in file name with a '/' at end. Press enter. 
     Write placeholder file name (i.e. test). Then jump down. This will 
     indicate this is a FOLDER and not a DOCUMENT. #mindblown

  <h3>
   To insert an image in folder: </h3>
     <p> Same as above step with exception that previously saved image 'file'
     (actually a document) in Ghub can be screenshot. Once screenshot is 
     taken, return to Ghub and copy image address. Delete previously 
     saved image file under subfolder (src) in Ghub. Open newly created folder 
     and insert image from computer into folder. Done.
