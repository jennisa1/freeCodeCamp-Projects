    <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
    <h2>Target Attribute</h2>
    <p>
      For Step 13, I learned how to add an attribute to my anchor
      element's opening tag. I did this by going to my opened 
      anchor element and inserting the target attribute after the
      'a href' link. The purpose of making a target attribute with 
      a value of '_blank' is to allow the cat photos link to open 
      up a new tab. This is shown below.

    <h2>Nest Anchor Element in IMG</h2>
    <p>
      Nested anchor element in the image to make an image link. Did
      this by taking the instructed link, 'https...freecatphotoapp..
      ..com' and added an 'a href' before the 'img src' link. Closed
      the anchor element after 'alt' at end. Shown below.
