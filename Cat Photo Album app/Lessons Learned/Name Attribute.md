    <h1>Lessons Learned--Name Attribute</h1>
    <p>
      Created a name attribute, 'catphotourl' within the self-closing input element. 
      This was added after the type attribute. If the name attribute is hard to
      read like it was for me, it says 'cat photo url' indicating the location of
      the action attribute/providing a value so the data can be submitted. As seen
      below, the name attribute has turned into a blank text box below the H2 Cat
      Form in the output. 
    </p>
