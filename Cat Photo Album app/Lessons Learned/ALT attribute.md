    <h1>Lessons Learned--ALT Attribute</h1>
    <p>
      Learned how to add an ALT attribute to my image element. The alt attribute goes
      behind the img src link. To code the alt attribute, insert the title of the image
      within the quotation marks located at the end of the HTML tag. This will act as 
      a placeholder in the event something happens to the img src link. An image of
      the alt attribute can be found in the image below.
