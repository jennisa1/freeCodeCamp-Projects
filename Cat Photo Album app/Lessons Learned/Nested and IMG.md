    <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
    <h2>Nesting</h2>
    <p>
      Learned how to nest my p element so it aligned with the h2 and comment.
      By indenting two spaces, the nesting element allowed the HTML appear 
      simpler to read. This is evident in the image below.

  <h2>IMG Element</h2>
    <p>
     Learned how to incorporate an img element to my CatPhotoApp website.
     This was done by creating an image element with an open tag (otherwise
     known as a self-closing tag). Though an image has yet to appear
     under the paragraph, I inserted the open image tag beneath the p 
     element. This is shown below.
