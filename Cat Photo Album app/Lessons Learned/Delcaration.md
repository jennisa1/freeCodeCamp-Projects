    <h1>Lessons Learned--Declaration</h1>
    <p>
      Learned how to create a declaration at the beginning of my HTML by inserting an open HTML element (in line 1
      before lang attribute). Added an exclamation point, then the words, 'DOCTYPE' in capslock, followed by HTML
      at the end. Inserting a declaration ensures that the browser meets industry standards. This is shown in the 
      code below.
