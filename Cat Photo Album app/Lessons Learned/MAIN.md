    <h1> Lessons Learned--Main Section</h1>
    <p>
     Learned how to make a main section.In order to have the HTML
     be easier to read and simpler to identify what content
     area the web developer is working with. The main section
     of the CatPhotoApp starts behind the H1 element and ends
     after the closing p element. The purpose of adding a
     main section allows for cleaner readability and SEO 
     (Search Engine Optimization) convenience. An image of the
     code is shown below.
