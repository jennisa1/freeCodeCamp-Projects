    <h1>Lessons Learned--id Attribute</h1>
    <p>
      Learned how to create an id attribute with the value 'indoor' to the radio button.
      This was done by making a space after the radio button (in the self-closing input
      type attribute) and adding the id attribute followed by an equals sign with the text,
      'indoor' (in lowercase letters) inside the quotation marks. The purpose of the id 
      attribute is to provide a way to uniquely identify various HTML elements and other 
      id values on my webpage.
