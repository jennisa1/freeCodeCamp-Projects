    <h1>Lessons Learned--Paragraph Element</h1>
    <p>
      Learned how to create a paragraph element under headline 2.
      Directions stated the paragraph element needed the text:
      'Click here to view more cat photos.' In order to do create
      the action needed for this text, we must learn how to open 
      and close the paragraph element. To open the paragraph 
      element, type html tags with letter 'p' inseted in the 
      middle. Then enter the 'click here...photos' text directly 
      after the p element. Once the text has been entered, we 
      must close the paragraph element with a '/p' inserted
      within the html tags. This will create a new paragraph 
      under h2 with the opening line in the image below.
