    <h1>Lessons Learned--Anchor Element</h1>
    <p>
      Learned how to create an Anchor Element after my p element. The purpose of 
      the Anchor Element is to provide a link to another page on my website.
      Though the link has yet to physically appear on my website, adding an
      anchor allows me to set up the link which will connect to the other said
      webpage. This is shown below.
