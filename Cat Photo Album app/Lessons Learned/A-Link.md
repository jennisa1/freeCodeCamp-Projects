    <h1>Lessons Learned--Anchor Link</h1>
    <p>
      Wow...This part left me in a serious pickle. For this step, I was
      instructed to take the anchor text and convert it into an anchor 
      link by nesting it in the p element 'Click here to view more cat
      photos.' First, I removed the closing p element tag and words,
      'cat photos' (from the p element). The p element should now say
      'Click here to view more.' Second, I moved the 'a href' over to
      the open p element. Third, I added HTML tags between the a href
      link and closing anchor tag with the words, 'cat photos.' Why?
      Because only one 'cat photos' is needed to hyperlink it (and
      it's not the one in p element, I'll tell you ðŸ¤¡). Lastly, add
      the closing p element after the closed anchor text. Then bam!
      Yup, that's literally it. 
      All of this is shown below.
