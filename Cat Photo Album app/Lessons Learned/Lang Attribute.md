    <h1>Lessons Learned--Lang Attribute</h1>
    <p>
      Learned how to create a lang attribute and set the HTML to the English language. Did this by going to 
      the open HTML element (first line of code) and inserting a space, followed by lang equals 'en' in 
      quotation marks to signify the English language. THen, outside the open HTML element, enter a space 
      and enter the word 'English' (with a capital E). Lowercase 'en' is the value and uppercase 'E' for 
      English represents the langauge of the page being set in English. This is shown in the code below.
