    <h1> Lessons Learned--Commenting</h1>
    <p>
     Learned how to create a comment above the p element using the phrase
     'Add link to cat photos.' To comment the given phrase, first add html 
     tags with an exclamation mark followed by two dashes. Then, add the 
     the words 'TODO' in all caps followed by a colon. After, insert the 
     phrase: 'Add link to cat photos.' Once the phrase is entered, place
     two dashes at the end of the html tag. The purpose of this comment 
     allows the web developer's memos to be coded without changing 
     what appears on the browser. This can also make the web developer's
     code idle. Hence, the comment in the Cat Photo App suggests that 
     the web developer should add a link to cat photos above the p element.
     An image of the code is shown below.
