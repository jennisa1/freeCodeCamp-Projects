    <h1>Lessons Learned--Meta Element</h1>
    <p>
      Learned how to create a meta element by going beneath the head element and making an open HTML tag
      with the words, 'meta charset equals UTF-8' as instructed by freecodecamp for my CatPhotoApp.
      Charset stands for 'character set,' which indicates the website's need to encode multiple langauges
      for users whose native langauge does not consist of the English langauge. UTF-8 is the charset 
      attribute value and stands for, 'UCS Transformation Format 8', or the web's most common character
      encoding system for Unicode. This information is paraphrased and found in Google Search Results 
      in addition to freeCodeCamp. The meta element code can be found in the image below.
