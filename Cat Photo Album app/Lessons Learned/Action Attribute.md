    <h1>Lessons Learned--Action Attribute</h1>
    <p>
      Learned how to create an attribute action to my form element. Specifically,
      I nested the action attribute within the open form element. I was provided
      with a link by freecodecamp and was told to use the link as the action
      attribute value. This is shown below.
