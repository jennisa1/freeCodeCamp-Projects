    <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
    <h2>Figure Element</h2>
    <p>
      Learned how to create a figure element by inserting the words, 'figure'
      in both open and closed HTML tags. The directions asked me to nest
      the figure element within the image, so I  placed the opened figure 
      element beneath the closed UL and the closed figure element after the
      alt attribute value. This resulted in the lasagna picture being 
      indented and shifted the right. See images below.

    <h2>figcaption</h2>
    <p>
      Learned how to add a figcaption element with the text: 'Cats love lasagna' 
      beaneath the lasagna image output. This was done by placing both open and
      closed HTML tags after the alt attribute with the previously stated text.
      A caption now resides underneath the lasagana image in the output.
      This is shown below.
