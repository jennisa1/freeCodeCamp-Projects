    <h1>Lessons Learned--Figure Element</h1>
    <p>
      Learned how to create a figure element by inserting the words, 'figure'
      in both opened and closed HTML tags. The directions asked me to nest
      the figure element within the image, so I  placed the opened figure 
      element beneath the closed UL and the closed figure element after the
      alt attribute value. This resulted in the lasagna picture being 
      indented and shifted the right. Check it out below.
