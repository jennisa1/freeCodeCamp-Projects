    <h1>Lessons Learned--Type Attribute with Value</h1>
    <p>
      Learned how to add a type attribute with the value, 'Submit' in the button element.
      Nest the the type attribute (type equals Submit in quotation marks) in open button
      element. This will ensure a clear submit button is in place in the code. This does 
      not have a noticeable impact in the output because the input and button elements 
      are inline elements (meaning they appear in the same line in the output despite
      being in different lines in code). This is show below.
